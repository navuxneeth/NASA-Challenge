# ✅ Implementation Complete - Real API Integration

## Problem Statement Addressed

**Original Request:**
> "i want you to use real apis to show real globe, real nasa stuff etc. it should be more interactive. add a new file as well where i can paste required the api keys (for eg for globe etc) but make sure that the api keys are very very easily accessible and are completely free of cost etc. use free stuff. you can use non-nasa apis as well for some stuff. write the instructions in simple words in the readme as to how i can add all that and adjust the images etc for placeholders that youve used, by adding images."
