## What This Project Does

This website shows you real NASA data like:
- Where the International Space Station is RIGHT NOW
- Real wildfires, storms, and other Earth events happening today
- Real NASA photos you can search and view

## Do I Need to Do Anything?

**NO!** Most features work immediately. Just open `index.html` in your web browser.

## But Can I Make It Better?

**YES!** Here's how (super easy):

1. Go to this website: https://api.nasa.gov/
2. Type your first name, last name, and email
3. Click the blue "Signup" button
4. Check your email - you'll get an API key (looks like: `abcd1234efgh5678`)
5. Open the file `config.js` with Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)
6. Find this line:
   ```
   NASA_API_KEY: 'DEMO_KEY',
   ```
7. Change it to:
   ```
   NASA_API_KEY: 'your-key-from-email',
   ```
8. Save the file
9. Refresh the website

**That's it!** Now you can load more NASA images without limits.

### Option 2: Add Your Own Space Images (5 minutes)

Want to customize the background images?

1. Create a new folder called `images` next to the HTML file
2. Download space images from NASA:
   - Go to: https://images.nasa.gov/
   - Search for what you want (example: "Earth from ISS")
   - Click an image you like
   - Right-click ‚Üí "Save image as..."
3. Save images with these exact names:
   - `earth.jpg` - Earth from space
   - `iss.jpg` - Space station
   - `cupola.jpg` - The window on ISS
   - `nbl.jpg` - Training pool
4. Put all images in the `images` folder
5. Refresh the website

**Done!** Your custom images will show up.

## What If Something Doesn't Work?

### "The ISS location says 'Loading...' forever"

- This happens if your internet blocks the ISS tracking website
- The rest of the site still works fine
- Try on a different internet connection

### "Gallery shows 'Unable to load images'"

- Make sure you have internet connection
- The NASA images website might be temporarily down
- Try again in a few minutes

### "I can't find config.js"

- It's in the same folder as `index.html`
- On Windows: Right-click ‚Üí Open with ‚Üí Notepad
