## NASA Resources Used

- [Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/)
- [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html)
- [Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/content/neutral-buoyancy-laboratory)

## NEW: Real API Integration & Interactive World Map!

This project now includes REAL APIs with live data and an interactive world map:
- Interactive World Map - Custom-built canvas map showing ISS position in real-time
- Real-time ISS position tracking - Watch the ISS orbit Earth live on the map
- Live Earth events from NASA EONET (wildfires, storms, etc.)
- Real NASA images searchable gallery
- Weather data integration
- Fire tracking from NASA FIRMS

All APIs are 100% FREE and easy to set up!

## Setup Instructions (Super Easy!)

### Step 1: Get Your Free NASA API Key

1. Go to [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. Fill in your name and email (takes 30 seconds!)
3. Click "Signup"
4. Check your email for your API key
5. Open `config.js` in a text editor
6. Replace `DEMO_KEY` with your new API key:
   ```javascript
   NASA_API_KEY: 'your-key-here', // Replace DEMO_KEY with your key
   ```

**Note:** The `DEMO_KEY` works but has limited requests. Getting your own key is free and gives you 1000 requests/hour!

### Step 2: That's It!

Most features work without any API keys because they use free public APIs:
- ISS Location Tracking (No key needed)
- NASA Image Search (No key needed)
- Live Earth Events (No key needed)
- Weather Data (No key needed)

The NASA API key is only needed for:
- Higher rate limits
- Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
- Earth imagery from specific dates

### Step 3: Add Your Own Images (Optional)

Want to customize the placeholders with your own images?

1. Create a folder called `images` in the project directory
2. Add your images with these names:
   - `earth.jpg` - Earth from space
   - `iss.jpg` - International Space Station
   - `cupola.jpg` - Cupola window view
   - `nbl.jpg` - Neutral Buoyancy Lab

You can download free NASA images from:
- [NASA Image Gallery](https://images.nasa.gov/)
- [NASA's Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/)
- [ISS Gallery](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/images/index.html)

**How to download images:**
1. Visit one of the links above
2. Search for what you want (e.g., "ISS Cupola")
3. Right-click on image → "Save image as..."
4. Save to the `images` folder with the correct name
5. Refresh the webpage!

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Local)
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Navigate through sections using the header menu or scroll
3. Interact with all the features!

### For Full API Features (Recommended)
The APIs work best when deployed to a web server. You can:

**Option 1: Use a Local Server**
```bash
# Python (easiest)
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open: http://localhost:8080

# Node.js
npx http-server -p 8080

# PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

**Option 2: Deploy for Free**
- GitHub Pages (recommended): Push to GitHub, enable Pages in settings
- Netlify: Drag and drop your files
- Vercel: Connect your GitHub repo
- Any web hosting: Upload files via FTP

> **Note:** When opening the HTML file directly (file://), you may see CORS errors in the console. This is normal for local development. The website still works and looks great! For full API functionality, use one of the options above.

### What You Can Do

1. View real-time ISS position in the hero section
2. See live Earth events (wildfires, storms) in the Cupola section
3. Search NASA's image library - try "Mars", "Hubble", "astronaut"!
